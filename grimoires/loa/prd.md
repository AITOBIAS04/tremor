# Product Requirements Document: TREMOR

TREMOR (Threshold Resolution & Earth Movement Oracle) is a seismic intelligence construct converting real-time earthquake data into structured evidence bundles for binary and multi-class prediction markets.

## Product Vision

Ground truth first. The prediction market is the factory; calibrated Brier-scored training data is the product. [GROUNDED] src/index.js:22 exports TremorConstruct as the main entry point.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Market Operator
**As** market operator, **I want** auto-spawned prediction markets, **so that** I gather calibrated training data without manual detection.
[GROUNDED] src/index.js:192-198 auto-spawns Aftershock Cascade on M≥6.0; src/index.js:181-189 auto-spawns Oracle Divergence on M≥4.5 automatic.

### Story 2: Calibration Analyst  
**As** data scientist, **I want** position history and Brier scores, **so that** I measure calibration.
[GROUNDED] src/rlmf/certificates.js:28-30 implements Brier as (forecast - outcome)².

### Story 3: Risk Officer
**As** risk manager, **I want** quality scores, **so that** I assess data confidence.
[GROUNDED] src/processor/quality.js:47 computes composite 0-1 quality with 8 regional profiles.

### Story 4: Event Analyst
**As** analyst, **I want** evidence bundles, **so that** I validate TREMOR's reasoning.
[GROUNDED] src/processor/bundles.js:20 builds bundles with magnitude, location, quality, cross-validation.

## Feature Set

### Oracle Integration
[GROUNDED] USGS GeoJSON feeds via 7 URLs (src/oracles/usgs.js:10-18), polled every 60s default (src/index.js:26).
[GROUNDED] EMSC cross-validation queries independent magnitudes (src/oracles/emsc.js:16); divergence ≥0.3 flags Paradox Engine.
[INFERRED] IRIS mentioned in README but not implemented; no src/oracles/iris.js.

### Evidence Bundle Pipeline
[GROUNDED] Five-stage construction (src/processor/bundles.js:20-129):
1. Quality Scoring: Composite 0-1 from USGS status, gap, RMS, station count, density
2. Magnitude Uncertainty: Doubt price from type, station count, density, review status
3. Settlement Assessment: Three-tier (oracle/provisional_mature/market_freeze)
4. Theatre Matching: Filter by time, region, magnitude
5. Evidence Classification: ground_truth, provisional, provisional_mature, cross_validated, degraded

### Theatre Templates
[GROUNDED] Five templates with consistent create/process/resolve lifecycle:

1. **Magnitude Gate** (src/theatres/mag-gate.js:24): Binary — Will M≥X occur in region Y within Z hours?
2. **Aftershock Cascade** (src/theatres/aftershock.js:4): Multi-class — How many M≥4.0 aftershocks in 72h? (Buckets: 0-2, 3-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21+)
3. **Swarm Watch** (src/theatres/swarm.js:1): Binary — Will cluster produce M≥X in 7 days? (Signal: b-value drift)
4. **Depth Regime** (src/theatres/depth.js): Binary — Shallow or deep? (For subduction zones)
5. **Oracle Divergence** (src/theatres/paradox.js:4): Meta-market — Will reviewed mag differ from automatic by ≥0.3?

### RLMF Certificate Export
[GROUNDED] src/rlmf/certificates.js:77 exports certificates with:
- Position history (timestamp, forecast, evidence, reasoning)
- Brier score: Binary (forecast - outcome)², Multi-class (1/R)Σ(f_i - o_i)²
- Calibration bucket assignment (0.0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, etc.)
- Volatility and directional accuracy metrics

## Quality & Reliability

[GROUNDED] 87 tests across 26 suites (test/tremor.test.js, test/post-audit.test.js, test/geofon.test.js; node:test).
[GROUNDED] Zero external dependencies (package.json); Node.js 20+ only.
[GROUNDED] All integrations against public, free APIs (USGS, EMSC).

## Known Gaps

[ASSUMPTION] IRIS integration claimed in README but not implemented.
[ASSUMPTION] On-chain P&L attribution parameter exists (src/rlmf/certificates.js:77 options.on_chain) but not implemented.
[INFERRED] Regional profiles should be calibrated from historical M4.5+ catalog stats per region.
